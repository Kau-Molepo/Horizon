## 1. Introduction

The Horizon Payroll and HR Management System is designed to provide organizations with a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for managing payroll processes and human resources operations. By integrating dual authentication through Firebase and FastAPI, along with role-based access control (RBAC), the system ensures secure access while streamlining workflows. With a focus on adaptability, the platform features both mobile (Flutter) and desktop (Python GUI) interfaces to cater to diverse user needs.

### Objectives
- Automate payroll processing to reduce administrative overhead.
- Streamline HR processes for improved employee engagement.
- Enhance security and user experience through modern authentication methods.

## 2. System Architecture

The Horizon system architecture is designed for modularity and scalability, ensuring efficient interaction between various components.

### Key Components

#### Frontend:
- **Flutter**: A cross-platform framework primarily used for mobile app development, allowing for easy adaptation for Windows desktop applications.
- **Python GUI**: A dedicated Windows executable interface designed for administrative tasks, offering a streamlined experience for users with different roles.

#### Backend:

#### Database:
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database that handles structured data storage, providing complex querying capabilities and transactional support.

#### Authentication:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Facilitates user identity verification and session management, ensuring secure access.

### System Flow
1. **User Authentication**: Users log in via Firebase, verified through credentials before accessing the system.
2. **API Gateway**: FastAPI serves as the central routing mechanism for requests, directing them to the appropriate service (payroll or HR).
3. **Database Interaction**: PostgreSQL stores user and operational data securely, allowing for efficient CRUD operations and complex transactions.

## 6. Technical Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Core framework for RESTful API development, leveraging Python's asyncio features for asynchronous operations.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Securely manages user identities and sessions, providing robust authentication methods (email/password, social logins).
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM layer for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, facilitating complex queries and schema migrations.

### Frontend
- **Flutter**: Utilized for mobile app development and can be compiled into a Windows executable for desktop use, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Python GUI**: A dedicated application built using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for Windows, tailored for administrative functionalities.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Structured data storage solution that supports advanced features like JSONB for semi-structured data, allowing for flexibility in data modeling.

## 7. User Authentication

Horizon employs a dual authentication mechanism to enhance security:

### Firebase Authentication:
- Users must authenticate through Firebase, which handles verification of credentials.
- Upon successful login, Firebase issues an ID token that represents the authenticated session.

### FastAPI Session Management:
- FastAPI validates the Firebase token on every request to ensure the user's session is still active.
- If valid, FastAPI generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) for further API interactions, allowing for seamless authorization checks against user roles and permissions.

### Workflow
1. User logs in via the frontend (Flutter or Python GUI).
2. The frontend sends credentials to Firebase, which returns an ID token.
3. The frontend then sends this token to the FastAPI backend for validation.
4. If valid, FastAPI responds with a session token, enabling access to secured endpoints.

## 8. API Endpoints

### Payroll API
- `POST /payroll`: Initiates payroll processing for the specified period.
- `GET /payroll/{employee_id}`: Retrieves detailed payroll information for a specific employee, including deductions and bonuses.
- `PUT /payroll/{id}`: Updates payroll details for a specific entry.
- `GET /payroll/slip/{employee_id}`: Generates and returns pay slips in PDF format for employees.
- `POST /overtime`: Records overtime hours for payroll adjustments.
- `GET /payroll/report`: Generates payroll reports for analysis.

### HR Management API
- `POST /employees`: Adds a new employee record to the database.
- `GET /employees/{employee_id}`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific employee.
- `PUT /employees/{employee_id}`: Updates employee data, such as contact information or job title.
- `DELETE /employees/{employee_id}`: Permanently removes an employee from the system.

- **Frontend**: Mobile applications are packaged via Flutter for distribution on app stores. The Python GUI is compiled into an executable for Windows.

### Environment Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the backend, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary Python packages.
   - For the Flutter frontend, run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Configure PostgreSQL database, setting up initial schema and required tables.
   - Use SQL scripts or migration tools to ensure the database is correctly initialized.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., Firebase credentials, database URLs) to ensure security and configuration flexibility.

4. **Launch Services**:
   - Start the FastAPI server using a command like `uvicorn main:app --reload` for development purposes.
   - Ensure that all services are connected and operational, testing endpoints to confirm functionality.

## 10. Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, such as passwords and personal information, is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using database encryption features).
- **Token Security**: Uses short-lived tokens with refresh mechanisms to maintain session security without risking exposure of long-lived credentials.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Ensures that users can only access features and data relevant to their roles, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data leaks.

### Regular Security Audits
Conduct routine security assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities, ensuring that security protocols are updated in response to evolving threats.

## 11. Scaling and Optimization

### Horizontal Scaling
Design the system to allow for horizontal scaling, where additional server instances can be added during high demand periods, such as payroll processing cycles.

### Asynchronous Processing
Utilize background tasks and message queues (e.g., Celery) to offload long-running processes like payroll calculations, ensuring the system remains responsive.

### Caching Strategies
Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data temporarily, reducing the load on the PostgreSQL database and improving performance.

### Database Optimization
Regularly analyze and optimize database queries, using indexing and partitioning to improve retrieval times and reduce resource consumption.

## 12. Future Enhancements

### Advanced Payroll Analytics
Develop dashboards for payroll managers to visualize trends and key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling data-driven decision-making.

### AI-powered Recruitment
Introduce machine learning algorithms to screen resumes and rank candidates, enhancing the recruitment process and reducing bias.

### Global Payroll Support
Extend functionalities to accommodate global payroll, handling different currencies, local tax regulations, and international compliance.

### Employee Self-Service Expansion
Enrich the employee portal with features like benefits management, training module access, and comprehensive performance feedback systems.

### Mobile App Enhancements
Implement features such as push notifications for important updates (e.g., payroll confirmations, leave approvals) to enhance employee engagement and responsiveness.
